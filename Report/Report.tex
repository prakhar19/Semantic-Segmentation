% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi


\usepackage{amsmath}
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally does.


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the

% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can

% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE

% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT

Convolutional networks due to their translation invariance, serve as powerful 
tools to detect key features from an image. This work shows the creation of a 
neural network using FCN + Deconvolution + Skip Connections. The network

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} introduction of Convolutional networks has revolutionized 
the field of machine learning. They have shown applications not only in image-based 
tasks but also in other problems such as Natural Language Processing. 
They serve as the state-of-art for almost all image-based problems.

Fully Convolutional Networks, are an excellent way to extract prominent features 
from an image and are also fast. In order to maintain their speed, they use 
pooling layers at intervals to decrease image resolution. But, this also limits 
the networks' ability to resize the image back, as a great deal of information 
gets lost in the process. Hence, the output from an FCN needs to be upscaled 
using techniques such as Bilinear Upscaling. In this work, we use an advanced 
way of upscaling called Deconvolution. Deconvolutions are reverse convolutions 
and increase the size of the image. Like convolutions, they can be trained too. 

This work uses FCNs and Deconvolution networks to decompose image scenes into 
separate meaningful identities. This task is also known as Semantic Segmentation.

\subsection{Semantic Segmentation}
Semantic refers to "meaning in language or logic", and when we talk about 
semantically segmenting an image we mean to divide the image into meaningful 
parts, such as physical objects.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cat-semantic-segmentation.png}
    \caption{Semantic Segmentation}
    \label{fig:semantic_segmentation}
\end{figure}

For example, Fig.~\ref{fig:semantic_segmentation} has been segmented 
into 4 different categories (Cat, Table, Chair, and Background). As it might 
be evident, this task is not achievable using unsupervised methods. We need to 
define the desired segmentation categories, as an image with infinite detail 
could be segmented into an infinite number of categories.



\section{Network Architectures}

\subsection{Fully Convolutional Networks}
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) (Fig.~\ref{fig:fully-convolutional-network}) 
are what one gets on building a neural network using only convolutional-type 
layers. They keep the spatial information of an image intact.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fcn.png}
    \caption{Representation of an FCN (Source: J. Long et al, 2015\cite{long2015fully})}
    \label{fig:fully-convolutional-network}
\end{figure}

In the training process, they learn to highlight the key features describing a 
class in the image. With increasing network depth, receptive fields of the 
convolution layers also increase. Starting layers learn to recognize simple 
features such as a straight line, and curves, while the later layers might be 
learning geometries as complex as a face.


\subsection{Deconvolution Networks}
Pooling layers decrease the dimensions of an image. To scale it back up to its 
original size, instead of using Bilinear techniques, we have used Deconvolution 
layers. Deconvolution layers act as reverse convolution layers, and serve the 
purose of scaling up an image. Like there counterparts, they too are learnable.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{deconvolution.png}
  \caption{Representation of a Deconvolution Network (Source: H Noh et al, 2015\cite{noh2015learning})}
  \label{fig:deconvolution-network}
\end{figure}



\section{Data Used}

\subsection{Cityscapes}
The Cityscapes dataset\cite{Cordts2016Cityscapes} offers pixel-wise segmented 
images from stereo videos recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities. 
It contains 5,000 fine quality and a larger set of 20,000 weakly annotated 
images. The images have a resolution of 2048 x 1024 pixels. For our purpose, 
we use the set of finely annotated images from the left camera.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{zuerich.png}
  \caption{Cityscapes Dataset}
  \label{fig:cityscapes_dataset}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Stanford Scene Understanding Dataset}

The Stanford Scene Understanding dataset\cite{liu2010single}, 
\cite{saxena2006learning}, \cite{saxena2009make3d} contains a total of 534 
images (400 training and 134 test), with labels comprising of 9 classes 
(unknown, sky, tree/bush, road/path, grass, water, building, mountain, 
foreground object). Resolution of the images is 240 x 320 pixels. This served 
as a testing dataset to check for convergence of our models.



\section{Segmentation Architecture}

We use a hybrid architecture of a Fully Convolutional Network, a Deconvolution 
Network, and skip connections.

The training images and the corresponding segmentation labels are downsampled 
from 2048 x 1024 pixels to 512 x 256 pixels. This step was necessary to keep 
the size of the compiled model in control.


\subsection{Skip Connections}
With increasing network depths, vanishing gradients cause the accuracy to 
decrease rapidly. Deeper networks also have slower training, as gradient changes 
become minute.

Skip connections solve these problems by joining the output of an earlier layer 
to a later one, skipping all those in between. These shortcut connections help 
in keeping the effect of gradients intact during backpropagation.

When using pooling layers, information gets lost at each step. This limits the
network's ability to resize the image back to its original size. Skip 
connections help pass the high-resolution information to later layers.


\subsection{Architecture}
The complete architecture can be found in the Appendix.

The network consists of 5 Convolution + Pooling layers, in the beginning, 
starting with a filter size of 128 and going up to 512. Convolution layers act 
as feature extractors. They detect key semantic features for each class. This 
process downscales the image too.

After training, the output of the last convolution layer represents a map of the 
detect features. This FCN is succeeded by a Deconvolution network, which upscales 
the image back to its original size.

The entire network consists of 3 skip connections, from the MaxPooling layers 
to Deconvolution layers of corresponding dimensions. These connections greatly 
increase accuracy.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but

% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places

\section{Results}

The trained model achieved a Mean IoU (Intersection over Union) accuracy of 
78.6\%, over the test data.

It was found that despite reducing the training image resolution by a factor 
of 16, the trained model was able to make good predictions even on larger images.

\section{Conclusion}


The network in this work can be further improved with the use of Conditional 
Random Field layers, which we plan to present in a future work.

The model was also tested with road scene images other than the dataset, and the 
results showed that the network was able to detect the classes properly, though 
the segmentation maps were not as good.

A shortcoming of the model was that it was not very good at predicting humans, 
and the segmentation map was jagged in most of the cases.

% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

% \begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
% Biography text here.
% \end{IEEEbiography}

% % if you will not have a photo at all:
% \begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
% Biography text here.

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
